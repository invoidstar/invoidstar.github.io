I am Qi Chu(初琦), currently studying Software Engineering at the School of Software, Jilin University, and expected to graduate in June 2026.

My current research focuses primarily on visual-text models, image restoration (deblurring, low-light enhancement), and video understanding (retrieval, recognition), among other areas.
